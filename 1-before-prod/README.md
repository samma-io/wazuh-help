# Wazuh Pre-Production Setup Guide

Before a Wazuh instance is ready for a live production environment, several critical tasks must be completed to ensure it is secure, stable, and operationally efficient.

This directory contains a collection of practical guides, scripts, and configuration examples for the essential steps I take before declaring a Wazuh deployment "production-ready."

## Key Configuration Areas

The guides in this folder cover the following key areas:

* **🔐 User Setup & Access Control:**
    * Moving beyond the default admin user.
    * Integrating with an Identity Provider (IdP) for Single Sign-On (SSO).
    * Configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to grant appropriate permissions to different teams (e.g., SOC Analysts, Auditors, Administrators).

* **🎟️ Ticketing System Integration:**
    * Connecting Wazuh to an external ticketing or case management system (like Jira, TheHive, or ServiceNow).
    * Automating the creation of tickets from high-severity alerts to streamline incident response workflows.

* **🛡️ System Hardening & Security:**
    * Replacing default TLS certificates with custom ones.
    * Changing default administrator credentials.
    * Hardening the underlying operating system of the Wazuh components.

* **💾 Backup & Recovery:**
    * Establishing a robust backup strategy for critical Wazuh data, including alerts, configurations, and user objects.
    * Documenting the disaster recovery procedure.

* **튜ニング Alert Tuning & Policies:**
    * Adjusting rule levels and configurations to reduce noise from false positives.
    * Setting up data retention policies (Index Lifecycle Management) to meet compliance requirements.

## How to Use This Directory

This folder is organized by task. Each sub-directory corresponds to one of the key areas listed above and contains the relevant documentation, scripts, and configuration files.
