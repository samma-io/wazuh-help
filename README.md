# My Wazuh Toolkit

This repository contains a collection of personal scripts, configurations, and actions I use to customize and enhance my [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) instances. Wazuh is a powerful open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platform, and these tools are designed to make it work even better for my specific needs.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main categories, each in its own directory:

1.  **üöÄ Pre-Production Tasks:** Essential configurations and hardening steps to perform *before* deploying a Wazuh instance into a live production environment.

2.  **üõ†Ô∏è Operational Improvements:** Scripts and guides for enhancing existing Wazuh functionality. This includes tasks like adding better monitoring on specific log sources or integrating alerts with external ticketing systems.

3.  **üß© Functionality Extensions:** Code and instructions for extending Wazuh's capabilities by integrating new, external data sources. The goal is to leverage the power of Wazuh's correlation engine for more security insights from platforms like Detectify, Secureframe, and more.

## How to Use This Repository

Each folder corresponds to one of the categories listed above. Browse the directories to find the specific scripts, configuration files, and documentation relevant to your needs.
